# Lacrosse Team Data Visualizations

## Overview
This project showcases 25 years of lacrosse team data from Misancordia University. The visualizations are designed to provide insights into both **career-level** and **season-level** performance for offensive and other key statistics. The goal is to highlight trends, top performers, and team dynamics over time in a clear and interactive way using Power BI.

## Data Sources
- Historical lacrosse statistics for the past 25 years
- Player career and season statistics
